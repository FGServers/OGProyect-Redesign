    The actual relocation first takes place 24 hours after activation. In this time, you can use your planets as normal. A countdown shows you how much time remains prior to the relocation.<br />
    <br />
    Once the countdown has run down and the planet is to be moved, none of your fleets that are stationed there can be active. At this time, there should also be nothing in construction, nothing being repaired and nothing researched. If there is a construction task, a repair task or a fleet still active upon the countdown`s expiry, the relocation will be cancelled.<br />
    <br />
    If the relocation is successful, you will be charged 240,000 Dark Matter. The planets, the buildings and the stored resources including moon will be moved immediately. Your fleets travel to the new coordinates automatically with the speed of the slowest ship. The jump gate to a relocated moon is deactivated for 24 hours.',
